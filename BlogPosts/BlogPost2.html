                    <p>I am going to document the challenges I face throughout my Projects and around my general knowledge of theory, syntax, code architecture etc.
                        As I haven't had any educational experience of code architecture or best practices, I am already facing issues with this portfolio websites development.
                        As expected, I have encountered several obstacles that have required me to seek out solutions and learn new concepts as I progress. Some basic issues I have faced include: the hierarchy of elements in HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality.
                        As well as this, finding a suitable layout for the mobile version of the site has been a challenge, as I have had to learn about media queries and responsive design principles to ensure that the site looks good on all devices and the screen doesn't look too crowded.

                        One issue I faced was on a mobile display, the "Meet me!" text bubble and waving hand/profile picture would clip through onto the surface of other sections, 
                        this was a simple fix which I had not previously known, using Z-index establishes which elements get priority, i implemented this and now page does not have this glitch.

                        <h6><strong>22/07/2025</strong></h6>
                        I have been having issues with the navigation bar on mobile, the menu button was not functioning correctly and I was unable to open and close the menu.
                        After researching this issue, I found that I had not linked the JavaScript file correctly, which was causing the problem. I have now fixed this and the menu is working as intended.

                        <h6><strong>27/07/2025</strong></h6>
                        Creating an effect to blur the images for my 'Projects' and 'Education' section proved to be quite difficult, as I had to learn about CSS filters and how to apply them to become not blurred on hover.
                        After some trial and error, I was able to achieve the desired effect and the images now have a nice blur effect when hovered over. This adds a nice touch to the overall design of the site and makes it more visually appealing.

                        <h6><strong>03/08/2025</strong></h6>
                        I have been working on improving the overall design and layout of the site, as well as adding new features and functionality. One issue I faced was with the alignment of text and images in the 'About Me' section.
                        The concept of adding new elements to the 'Hero' section was also a challenge, as I had to tackle the flex box layout to ensure that the elements were properly aligned and spaced. After some experimentation, I was able to achieve the desired layout and the section now looks much better.

                        I have been working on a Carousel feature for my Tech Stack section, which allows users to scroll through different technologies and view more information about each one.
                        This has been a challenging task, as I had to learn the specific JavaScript syntax in order to be able to make it loop around on itself and how to implement the necessary event listeners for user interaction.
                        After some trial and error, I was able to get the carousel working as intended and it adds a nice touch to the overall design of the site. I am proud of the progress I have made so far and am excited to continue learning and improving my skills as I work on this project.

                        I have been working on my PS2 Emulator project, which has been a challenging but rewarding experience. One issue I faced was with the implementation of the CPU emulation, as I had to learn about the specific architecture and instruction set of the PS2 in order to accurately emulate its behavior.
                        This required a lot of research and experimentation, but I was able to overcome the challenges and make significant progress on the project. I am excited to continue working on this project and see how far I can take it. Hardware emulation is a completely new area for me, Every time i think I have
                        made progress with its development I find another issue that needs to be resolved, but I am determined to see it through to completion to the best of my ability.

                        <h6><strong>04/09/2025</strong></h6>
                        I have added a timeline to my history rather than 2 grid nodes, I believe this was a good idea a it presents my history in a more engaging and clear way.
                        This lead me to develop a keyframes animation for the timeline markers and other large elements within my website.
                        I am pleased with how it turned out and it adds a nice touch to the overall design of the site.
