                    <p>One issue i have noted is the scalability of the blog aspect of my portfolio website, I have chosen a process of implementing blog posts into my website which would be difficult to scale, it would make the code bulky and inefficient and due to my inexperience I do not know how to make this more efficient.</p>
                    <p>To develop my knowledge and become more efficient I am going to continue working on my other personal projects which include website development however as of 17/07/25 I am focusing on learning C# in order to be prepared for my Masters degree.</p>

                    <p>One issue I faced was on a mobile display, the "Meet me!" text bubble and waving hand/profile picture would clip through onto the surface of other sections, this was a simple fix which I had not previously known, using Z-index establishes which elements get priority, i implemented this and now page does not have this glitch. </p>
