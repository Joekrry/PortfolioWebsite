                    <h6>02/09/2025</h6>
                    <p>I recreated the concept of Geometry Wars 3 as a Personal Remaster with similar graphics and gameplay mechanics in C#</p>
                    <br>
                <p>My goal was to tweak the original game that I loved so much into something moulded to my own personal preference of the genre. I aimed to recreate similar graphics, and maintain core gameplay mechanics while implementing tweaks that fit my style.
                The gameplay mechanics were designed to be fast-paced and challenging, with a variety of enemy types and power-ups to keep players engaged. I implemented a scoring system that rewards players for their performance, encouraging them to improve their skills and achieve higher scores.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>The project was built using C# and the MonoGame framework, which provided a solid foundation for 2D game development. I focused on creating a visually appealing experience with vibrant colors, smooth animations, and dynamic effects to capture the essence of the original game.
